Local Practice...

2) "Nesting" git repos is bad practice, as subdirectories of a repo can be added (for the subdirectory ./foo/bar, if ./foo is a git repo, "git add ./foo/bar/*" will add the directory ./foo/bar and all of its contents to the ./foo repo). In addition, nesting creates many possible conflict scenarios, as both the ./planets/moons repo and the ./moons repo each have their own version history. 

The last "git init" (to the ./planets/moons repo) can be undone by deleting the repo itself:

$ rmdir ./planets/moons/.git/


3)  Screenshot attached.


4) #5 is the correct answer, for recovering the most recent commit of data_cruncher.py.


5) Nothing to do in this part, as far as I can tell...


6) My "planets" repo is hosted at: https://github.com/ubermenschen/planets
   
   GitHub records timestamps based on the time when the "$ git push origin master" command (or comparable) is used to push from your local repo to the remote. Since the remote is designed to be the "central" repo in a collaboration, to which collaborators can push/pull, this allows for  consistent timekeeping of the work performed by different collaborators. 
   
   
   
Remote Practice...
   
1) Repo is hosted at https://github.com/ubermenschen/rachel-planets


2) Version control can be used for keeping output from code synced with the version of code used to produce said output.
   figshare is a thing! A thing which I will be using...
